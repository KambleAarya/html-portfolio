<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal page! I am currently a university student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering in India. My academic journey is driven by a profound passion for technology and innovation, which has been a constant source of inspiration throughout my education. My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, and system design. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work on several projects that have allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, further solidifying my understanding and enthusiasm for the field.</p>

<p>Outside the classroom, I am actively involved in various extracurricular activities and tech communities. I am a member of the university's coding club, where I regularly participate in hackathons and coding competitions. These experiences have not only honed my coding skills but have also taught me the importance of teamwork and collaboration. I also volunteer as a mentor for junior students, helping them navigate the complexities of computer engineering and encouraging them to pursue their interests in technology.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the tech industry. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity. My curiosity drives me to continuously learn and experiment with new ideas, whether it be through online courses, personal projects, or tech blogs. As I look to the future, I am excited to continue my journey in computer engineering, with the goal of contributing to innovative solutions that can make a positive impact on society.</p>
